    # A Ziti Identity configuration section that specifically makes use of the cert and key fields to define

# web
# Defines webListeners that will be hosted by the controller. Each webListener can host many APIs and be bound to many
# bind points.

  # name - required
  # Provides a name for this listener, used for logging output. Not required to be unique, but is highly suggested.

    # bindPoints - required

    # where on the host machine the webListener will listen and the address (host:port) that should be used to
    # publicly address the webListener(i.e. mydomain.com, localhost, 127.0.0.1). This public address may be used for
    # incoming address resolution as well as used in responses in the API.

        # address - required

        # response content that requires full host:port/path addresses.

      # The maximum amount of idle time in milliseconds allowed for pipelined HTTP requests. Setting this too high

      # The maximum amount of time in milliseconds http servers will wait to read the first incoming requests. A higher
      # value risks consuming resources on the host with clients that are acting bad faith or suffering from high latency
      # or packet loss. A lower value can risk losing connections to high latency/packet loss clients.

      # The total maximum time in milliseconds that the http server will wait for a single requests to be received and

      # can risk ending requests before the server has a chance to respond.
